# A bit about me

Hi! I'm Somebud, also Somebud0180 at some places. I'm <span id="Age"></span> years old and dabble in a few things such as but not limited to coding and art. I am also a member of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)! (Find me at @Somebud)

I typically find myself coding with ease with Swift app development. I did also try a few things like game and web development. For game development, I went with Godot as my engine of choice.

I also got around to 3D modelling due to events and from recently getting a 3D Printer! While I do make "art", I would describe it as poorly drawn. I do wish to practice these further.

If you insist, you can find my art via my Instagram, along with my other socials through the link below.
