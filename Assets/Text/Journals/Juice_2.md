Recap:
_To quote my post

> 2 months ago, I saw a new hackathon and said, “It would be cool if I made a game and went to another country, right?”.

## We Juicing Now (Kinda):
I went my way to McDonald's, still phased by that immigration thing. And there I got, and of course I didn't talk to anyone as I was shy af at this point. Just decided to go hang around the group. Later on we went down the airport to the pickup area for the taxi and we got in groups. I decided to go with the 2nd group (iirc) and passed the first. As we board we went our ways and off to the hotel. The ride started chill and the conversation started. We had some debates and good discussions. The two Peirera siblings (I hope I got this right :sob:) from Canada gave us some maple candy at it was like nothing I've ever tasted. After a few cool talks and yaps we made it to our hotel! I went ahead and gave my passport for check-in as I continue to swallow the fact this thing is real. A bit of a moment later we got our keycards and I think I was able to meet my roommate, Arnav. We talked a bit and got to our hotel. _(Ok side note, I can't actually remember if we met and got to the room together or if I got there first and he came later. Details details.) So I saw our room and it was really awesome, I never really stay at cool hotels and this was one of them. So I decided to unpack a bit my electronics and hack away at my laptop for my game just abit. Not awhile later I fell asleep and woke up to my roommate telling me that dinner is soon and that if I fell asleep. I went up and rushed a bit to get myself up and fresh. We make our way down to see the large group of people as we prepare to leave the hotel to go to the restaurant. A little later we go and did our first walk in Shanghai. Night time, city lights, I captured the moment, my first picture of Juice. The moment since became unforgettable as the cold air whisped through us as we make our way to the restaurant. Fast forward a bit, I made my way to a table and got through some awkward conversations as I wasn't seated with the people I knew (different dietary restrictions and just fate). So I got and waited and saw the unique and very exotic (for my palette) food. So the food was very good and weird, but I'm really open to new cuisines at this era.

## Good Morning China!:
So night passed I had some good night's sleep as we go and- WE'RE LATE! We woke up like an hour past the call time or something and so we rushed our asses to the venue after readying up. We get there with a very awkward silence (but not really as Thomas is discussing what we'll be doing) as we made our way to a space where we can go sit down. Stuff happened and we got to merch! Cool merch and cool people, cool games too!

## The Disorganized Venue 1 Events:
At some point I was able to socialize with people and got my way to the little theater in the venue and watched a movie with other people, the movie being NeZha iirc. On top of this we also went and tried the juicer! The star of the show, I went and recorded some stuff and went away with it. Gameshow time and we made juice and got visitors in. I was kinda happy with what I made at that point as I went and just chilled at that point as far as I can remember. I was kinda antisocial at this time as no extroverts really adopted me during the time at the venue and I wasn't good at starting conversations. But nonetheless I found my fun and joy in this amazing event even in my silent and locked in times. One more notable thing is being grouped with Tongyu!!! I actually had two choices, Paolo for Video as a 1st choice and Tongyu for Music as 2nd. I actually wasn't that good with music but was strapped with beginner skills and beepbox and called it a day. One more thing! We had some hotpot and a few good night trips during this period. I remember going to the park on one night, grabbing boba on the way and seeing a coffee robot vending machine. One night we were also going around helping one another go try to bike! Though even after trying I still never got the hang of it. :sob:

## Venue 2, Electric Boogaloo:
New venue new hotel. Holy this hotel is massive, big ass room and big ass beds, and only me and my roommate. Anyway, after going and resting at my massive bed to myself, we went ahead and go to the venue (I think :sobsob:). This venue was very pretty with the greenery and pond by the side. Food! We hade some very good food at the venue, I remember one of our lunches was a big platter of sushi!!! Big ahh platter of sashimis and lots of other sushis. We also had subway dinner at some point and a few more other cool stuff. We also celebrated Tongyu and Kai Ling's birthday at the event! We also had some sewing thingy and shrink keychain which I also participated at! Lots and lots of cool stuff! Anyway voting happened on the last day as we began to wrap up and we showcased our game for one last time. We had some good times as we checked each others games, we did a peer voting with white rabbit candies and it was honestly very joyful to recieve some candy for my game! While I didn't win anything notable it was still fun to participate here. Another thing that happened during our time here is that we went to the zoo! I had a blast taking pictures there and seeing a red panda (waaa!). Anyway as the actual event closes I had a last hurrah as I went to the mall, had an odd lunch (Starbucks Sandwich) and bought some popmart for friends and my brother and I headed to the airport. I bid my farewell with the people I was with on the way to the airport and I went back home :sad:.

## Post-Juice:
So, first event, I had a massive blast and as with anything, dopamine crash. I kinda reminisced a lot first and I kinda had some good amount of dopamine to run off from. But a little side tangent, a lot of us added each other on Instagram as we had a chain in the slack channel to leave our channels and Insta account. I made some good amount of mutuals and I kinda grew a little more closer to being more comfortable sharing my interests in a certain community. And so I started reading this one webtoon after getting home and I was so invested I read about 90 chapters or like 2-3 years worth of chapters in ONE DAY. Nonetheless, however I did that, I crashed OUTTTTT so hard. I basically vented so much and it was certainly an experience having just returned from China, dealing with post-hackathon depression and then this spike and drop in dopamine yet again. Nonetheless post juice was a very notable experience too.


I didn't really get to **every** detail here, yes there are more, but I hope I got to cover everything I was really keen on sharing. I have a lot more of experiences that I could share but I would rather not drag on with this one. So yeah, Juice! If you're thinking of joining a hackathon, be it Hack Club or not, go try it! You never know, it might be the turning point of your life! Anyway signing off!
